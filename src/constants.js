  frog2:'Ribbit! We’re free! Maybe I’ll finally get to start a Youtube channel and beat Jabez tech..',
  cgirl1:'Oh wow, the King lost? Guess that means I’m single now. Tragic. Anyway, Castar, you got any plans tonight?',
  cboy1:'Welp, I served the old King, but I can serve the new one too! What’s your leadership style? Less torture, more pizza parties, maybe?',
